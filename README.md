### Description:

This is a react-based web application. I used [@mui v5](https://mui.com/) for design.  
It fetches the data from this [API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/)  

This is first version and It's not optimized for mobile devices but I will add some media queries soon to make this mobile friendly.

#### Instruction:

*   Click on the "Discover" button
*   Hover on any card to see full details
*   Click on read more to redirect on [https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/${anime\_id}](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/films/${anime_id})
*   This {anime\_id} means the ID and all the data is fetched from API already and passed as props to NewCard component.
*   Currently this application is only optimized for Desktop/Laptop views. So, please open the app on desktop devices.

<h6>Thank you</h6>
